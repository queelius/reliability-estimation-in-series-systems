- Likelihood ratio test. Fit to series system that is Weibull (same shape for all components)
    * Consider same scale too, if we find that for some small $n$ the same shape system fits data well.
    * If we find that the same shape system fits data well, then we can use the likelihood ratio test to compare the fit of the same shape system to the fit of the general system.
    * Easiest system is lambda1 = ... = lambdam, k1 = ... = km, and then we can compare to the general system.

- Weibull: combine some results into a single Theorem (see draft paper Agustin gave back to me for notes)

- Change R_{T_i} to \prod R_j (product of reliabilities) and h_{T_i} to \sum h_j (sum of hazard rates) to focus discussion
  around the components.
