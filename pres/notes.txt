1. talk about how $p = 0.215$ was chosen
2. mention that $q = 0.825$ was chosen arbitrarily. seemed like a good value.
3. incorporate skewness/bias into talk -- particularly for graphs. (BCa)
4. talk about the industrial settings that make it reason:

	- e.g., circuit board is replaced, reparing the system, but don't know which
	component on board failed. by design, this means that any time the board fails,
	these same components are usually in the candidate set, thus equal probability
	across components in candidate set.

	1. BCa: adjusts for bias, re-centering the ...
