In a well-designed series system, the components are chosen such that the failure characteristcs
of the components are similar, which suggests the shape parameters of the components are
similar. If we fit an MLE to the constrained likelihood model where the shape parameters are
constrained to be equal, then the MLE of the shape parameter ...


In this case, the series system itself is (approximately) Weibull and the component cause of failure
is approximately given by
$$
    \Pr\{K_i = j | \T_i = t_i \} = \Pr\{K_i = j\} = \frac{\lambda_j^{-\bar{k}}}{\sum_{l=1}^{m} \lambda_l^{-k}},
$$
which is independent of the system failure time $t_i$.
