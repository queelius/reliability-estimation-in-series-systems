# Future Work: Supplementary Material

Before I conclude, I want to take a moment to share some promising avenues for
further research that emerged during my studies but were beyond the scope of the
primary paper. These areas present intriguing opportunities for further
exploration.

## Collaborative Invitation

I am genuinely excited about the potential these paths hold and am keen on
collaborating with anyone interested in diving deeper into these topics. Whether
you're considering a new research direction or seeking ideas for projects for
students you're mentoring, I believe there's a wealth of possibilities here. It
would be a privilege to work together, contribute to your efforts, or simply
discuss these ideas further.

## Relaxation of Masking Conditions

Investigate relaxations of Conditions 1, 2, and 3...

- Condition 1 stipulates that...
- Explore potential of **KL-divergence**...

## Deviations from Well-Designed Systems

Assess the sensitivity of the estimator to deviations in system design...

- Preliminary findings suggest...

## Semi-Parametric Bootstrap

Consider the semi-parametric bootstrap approach...

- Possible benefits over the non-parametric method...

## Data Augmentation

Assess the robustness of Data Augmentation (DA)...

- Potential advantages of DA as an implicit prior...

## Penalized Likelihood For Homogenous Shape Parameters

Explore penalized likelihood methods...

- Weigh benefits against Data Augmentation...

## General Likelihood Model with Predictors

Expand the likelihood model to accommodate predictors...

- Incorporate different hazard function forms...

## Assess Calibration of Other Bootstrapped Statistics

Evaluate calibration of other bootstrapped statistics...

- Possible insights into system behaviors...

## Conclusion

The current results provide a solid foundation for extensions that can further
refine the methods and expand their applicability. I welcome further discussions
and collaborations in these domains.
