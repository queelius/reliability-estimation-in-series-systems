## Identifiability section

Corrected an error in the identifiabiltiy section. I meant to say I changed component 5 to have a lower MTTF,
but mistakenly said component 1. This is a problem because we were plotting the profile of the log-likelihood 
function for shape parameter 1 of component 1, which is not identifiable, but would have been identifiable
if we had changed the MTTF of component 1 to be much smaller. I have corrected this error in the paper,
and also added more clarification about what the profile plot is showing.
