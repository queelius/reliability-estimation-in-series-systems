## changes log

- added an equation Section 2.1: Component Cause of Failure which derives the
  probability that a component is the cause of a system failure (not depenend
  on time) since we may need this for the simulation section when showing how
  the MLE's bias changes when we change the probability that a particular
  component is the cause of system failure. 

- started changing notation like R(t) to prod_{l=1}^t R_l(t) to emphasize the product structure
